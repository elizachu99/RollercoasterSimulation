Assignment 2: Simulating a Roller Coaster
Author		: Elizabeth Chu
USC ID 		: 7188811403

Description: In this assignment, we use Catmull-Rom splines along with OpenGL texture mapping to create a roller coaster simulation.

Core Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher - Y

2. Completed all Levels:
  Level 1 : Y
  level 2 : Y
  Level 3 : Y
  Level 4 : Y
  Level 5 : Y

3. Used Catmull-Rom Splines to render the Track - Y

4. Rendered a Rail Cross Section - Y

5. Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation - Y

6. Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720) - Y

7. Understandably written, well commented code - Y

8. Attached an Animation folder containing not more than 1000 screenshots - Y

9. Attached this ReadMe File - Y

Extra Credit Features: (Answer these Questions with Y/N; you can also insert comments as appropriate)
======================

1. Render a T-shaped rail cross section - N

2. Render a Double Rail - N

3. Made the track circular and closed it with C1 continuity - N
